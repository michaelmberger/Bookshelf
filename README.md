# Bookshelf
Demo application to demonstrate CRUD operations

The application is a basic bookshelf. It does what you would expect a bookshelf to do: Add a book(C), read the titles of the bookshelf(R), and delete a book(D). If I think of something that makes sense for updating the bookshelf, I'll add it. 

Structure
Each application is first a command line application. This is to keep things simple and provide an easily testable starting point. 

Design philosophy
I will be using object oriented principles wherever practical although this will vary where the language does not have these features or lend itself to this paradigm.
